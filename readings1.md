## Q1

Density is dependant on temperature and pressure, since these two thermodynamic properties act to expand or collapse a given volume dV of a gas. These variablesare related by the ideal gas law, since density should be proportional to n/V.

## Q2

Pressure on the molecular scale can be seen as the force a given media exherts on a boundary, which is created by particles hitting each other. This impact creates a force that is proportional to that particles weight and speed. This translates to the macroscopic notion of pressure when the sum of all impacts is taken to be a force acting on a unit area. With this definition the probability that a particle will impact at any given time is also relevant, which is related to the temperature and volume of the gas.

Pressure does not have a direction since it is F/M^2 which means it must always be perpendicular to the surface since a pressure at a 45 degree angle on a surface would just be half of the normal pressure.

## Q3

It would rise 10cm or 0.1m on the other side and lower 10cm on the side of the plunger. This system is much like a scale used to weigh an object, since for the system to reach a stable equilibrium enough water must be lifted above the original quilibrium line to equal the pressure being applies through the incompressable fluid by the plunger on the other side.

## Q4

The water is moving at 1m/s for 3 hours, so the water at the upstream station will have moved about 10km in those three hours. Using the principal of advection, the water now at the lower station will have the same properties as the water previously 10 kilometers above the station. I'll assume that the caffeine has increased linearly from 100 to 150 g/m^3 since that is the simplest explination, thus the concentration would be 105g/m^3.
Advection allows for a preferable frame of refernce for an Eulerian perception of a quantity such that this refernce minimizes the change of the point being measured in the Eularian framework.
