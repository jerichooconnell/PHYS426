## Q1

There should not be any energy needed to keep the water moving since it has inertia. However there is internal energy necessary to keep the water liquid.

Gravity could be providing a potential energy gradient for the water to be moving.

## Q2

If the channel loses half of it's width then it will be half as deep. So every square area dA would be transformed into a rectangle. So perhaps the ratio of the distance between the dye and the area dyed.

With the widening of the channel the moving of the walls in the direction dx will result in a force imbalance near the wall that will propegate through the fluid. 

Other forces are the viscocity of the fluid, and turbulence in the fluid which both result in work done as friction in the fluid.

## Q3

Normal force from the cylinder as well as frictional force from the fluid caused the deformation. In this coordinate system. The rate of work will be proportional to the time, frictional force and speed that you drag it through the water. Further there might be higher order terms with frictional force and speed that become more pronounced as the speed gets larger due to turbulence..
