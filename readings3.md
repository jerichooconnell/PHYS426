## Q1 

Vorticity is the Curl of the fluid vector field and thus measures the tendancy for the fluid to flow in a circular motion. The angular rotation is twice the vorticity in a rigid body, but does not make sense for a deforming fluid parcle. Vorticity is twice the angular velocity since the curl of a rotating rigid body is twice it's angular velocity.

## Q2

If v is very small we can remove that term. Vorticity is only in Z, so we are left with (omega)z dot d/dz u. It follows that u must be positive to produce this curl and therefore Dw/Dt is positive. This follows from conservation of momentum.

## Q3

If the loop is closed at one moment in time and closed in another then it follows that the circulation is constant for all particles on this path, since for all the particles to move on the same trajectory they must all have the same speed since it would be impossible for one particle to pass another in a closed loop. Thus this property is irrespective of the type of vortex.
